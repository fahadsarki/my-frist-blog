# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Welcome to git and github 

git init initializes the repo
git add . adds it to staging
git commit -m "description goes here" for making commits
git status to check status of your changes
git log to show your commits

git restore . for restore
git restore --staged filedirectory
eg
git restore --staged index.html
or
git restore -S .
both are the same

git rm filename
for deletion that is staged and ready for commit
eg
git rm index.html

git mv oldname newname
to rename file and move to staging for commit
eg
git mv index.html home.html


use git amend to edit previous commit
use pop up to describe commit
git commit --amend 

use git log --online to show a compressed version of log


use git reset hashtag to return to a previous version of a commit
it ustages them
with this you can discard changes using restore or add them
eg
git reset c0771fd
